### Problem Recap:

You are given a rope of length `n`, and you can cut it into pieces of length `a`, `b`, or `c`. The goal is to maximize the number of pieces you can get by cutting the rope.

### Recursive Approach:

1. **Base Cases**:
    
    - If the length of the rope `n` is `0`, we return `0` because no cuts are needed.
    - If the length of the rope `n` is negative, return `-1` as it's an invalid cut, meaning we can't proceed with this cut.
2. **Recursive Calls**:
    
    - For each possible piece length (`a`, `b`, `c`), recursively compute the maximum number of pieces we can get by subtracting that length from `n`. Each time we subtract a length, we add 1 to the result (indicating the cut was made).
    - Finally, choose the maximum number of pieces from all three options.

### Solution Code in Java (without memoization):

public class RopeCutting {
    
    // Recursive function to find the maximum number of pieces
    public static int maxPieces(int n, int a, int b, int c) {
        // Base Case: If the rope length is 0, no more cuts can be made
        if (n == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        // Base Case: If the rope length is negative, it is not possible to cut
        if (n < 0) {
            return -1;  // Returning -1 to indicate an invalid state
        }
        
        // Recursively calculate the maximum pieces for each possible cut
        int cutA = maxPieces(n - a, a, b, c);
        int cutB = maxPieces(n - b, a, b, c);
        int cutC = maxPieces(n - c, a, b, c);
        
        // If none of the cuts are possible, return -1 to indicate no valid cuts
        if (cutA == -1 && cutB == -1 && cutC == -1) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        // Find the maximum of the three options, and add 1 (for the current cut)
        int max = Math.max(cutA, Math.max(cutB, cutC));
        
        // Return the maximum number of pieces (adding 1 for the current piece cut)
        return max + 1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 5;  // Length of the rope
        int a = 2;  // First piece length
        int b = 3;  // Second piece length
        int c = 5;  // Third piece length
        
        int result = maxPieces(n, a, b, c);
        
        // Print the result
        if (result == -1) {
            System.out.println("It's not possible to cut the rope into valid pieces.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Maximum number of pieces: " + result);
        }
    }
}


### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Base Cases**:
    
    - If the rope length `n` is `0`, we return `0`, as no more cuts are needed.
    - If the rope length `n` is less than `0`, it indicates that a cut is not possible, and we return `-1`.
2. **Recursive Step**:
    
    - We make three recursive calls, each corresponding to cutting the rope by lengths `a`, `b`, and `c`. Each recursive call reduces the rope length by one of the piece lengths and attempts to find the maximum number of pieces for the remaining length.
    - After each recursive call, if the result is valid (`>= 0`), we compare it to find the maximum possible number of pieces.
    - The `+1` accounts for the current cut we just made.
3. **Invalid Case Handling**:
    
    - If none of the recursive calls return a valid number (i.e., all of them return `-1`), we return `-1` to indicate that it's not possible to cut the rope into the desired lengths.
4. **Main Function**:
    
    - We call the `maxPieces` function and print the result. If the result is `-1`, we inform the user that it's impossible to cut the rope into valid pieces. Otherwise, we display the maximum number of pieces.

### Example Output:

For the input where `n = 5`, `a = 2`, `b = 3`, and `c = 5`, the output will be:

typescript

Copy

`Maximum number of pieces: 2`

This result comes from cutting the rope into pieces of lengths `2` and `3`, which maximizes the number of pieces.

### Time Complexity:

- The time complexity of this solution is **O(3^n)** because for each length `n`, we make three recursive calls, each reducing the problem size by one of the piece lengths. This leads to exponential growth in the number of recursive calls.

### Space Complexity:

- The space complexity is **O(n)** due to the recursion depth. In the worst case, the recursion depth can go as deep as the length of the rope, `n`.
